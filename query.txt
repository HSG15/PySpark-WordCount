I'm new with Spark and I learned that there are transformations and actions. 
Transformations return new rdds and dataframes, and actions make operations on them. 
Unless an action is not called, no transformations are performed. 
Transformations are just steps in the lineage unless any action is requested. 
So, when I read a dataframe it is also a transformation and if I call two actions
on the same dataframe after reading it, is it read twice or read only once and then actions performed on them?

df = ss.read.csv('test.csv')
df.count()
df.take(5)
